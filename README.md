# C++ Program to Count Valid Numbers

This C++ program takes a series of numbers as input from the user and counts the number of valid numbers. A valid number is a number that is divisible by 8.

## Code Structure

The code consists of a class called `assignment` and a `main()` function.

### assignment Class

The `assignment` class has three member functions:

1. `get_data()`: This function takes a number as input from the user.
2. `checking()`: This function checks if the number is valid (divisible by 8). If the number is valid, it increments the count variable. The function continues to take numbers as input until an invalid number is entered.
3. `display()`: This function displays the total number of valid numbers.

### main() Function

The `main()` function is the entry point of the program. It creates an object of the `assignment` class and calls the `get_data()`, `checking()`, and `display()` functions in sequence.

## Example Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Enter a number when prompted.
3. If the number is valid (divisible by 8), the program will ask for another number.
4. If the number is invalid (not divisible by 8), the program will display the total number of valid numbers.

Example output:
